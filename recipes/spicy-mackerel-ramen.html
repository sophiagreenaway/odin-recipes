            <li>1 packet Shin Ramyun noodles</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 4.05 oz can of mackerel, in oil or in brine</li>
            <li>2 oz of broccolini</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1/2 a tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds to infuse the butter with flavor.</li>
            <li>Add the broccolini and a little salt. Cook, tossing occasionally for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>You will now need to create steam in the pan to help the broccolini soften. Add a couple tablespoons of water and cover the pan.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, covered, for 3-5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender and bright green, then remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Cook ramen according to package instructions. Add the flavor packet. Discard the dried vegetable packet.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp of cold butter to the noodles in the broth. Stir and let it emulsify.</li>
            <li>Transfer your noodles to a bowl. Top with your broccolini and the canned mackerel.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
